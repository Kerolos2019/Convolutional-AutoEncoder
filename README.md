# Convolutional-AutoEncoder

AutoEncoder is  is a sequential model , it consists of two parts , encoder network which compresses the image and it is used to extract the features from the image , a decoder network which decompresses it  ,it is used in many applications like:

1-noise removal

2-Image compression

3-Demintionality reduction 



I have exposed to two kinds of AutoEncoder , the Linear AutoEncoder and Convolutional AutoEncoder and the different between them that the first one uses fully connected layer and the second one uses convolutional neural network and I have used Cifar10 dataset to implement Convolutional AutoEncoder
